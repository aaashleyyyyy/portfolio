                <p class = "about-text">Hello! My name is Ashley and I'm a creative at heart. Whether through web design, data design, painting or photography. I have a deep innate love for creative problem solving.</p>
                <br>
                <p class = "about-text"> I'm born and raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, specifically, South San Francisco...which is not in San Francisco but next to the SFO Airport. I grew up with a love of crafting, whenever I had the chance, I would make mini works of art with paper...and not clean up which annoyed my mom A LOT. </p>
                <br>
                <p class = "about-text">Currently, I'm a student at UC Berkeley double majoring in Data Science and Psychology. Originally an intended Business major, but by sophomore year, I found myself immensely captivated my data science classes and decided to switch my major. Psychology highlights the similarities and uniqueness between humans. Fascinated by my social psychology class, last summer, I decided to take the leap and double major to satiate my curiosity for the subject.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p class = "about-text">Outside of school, I'm discovering the wonders of coffee and creating latte art...currently my skills are only sub par, but improving. Additionally, I'm currently learning Spanish via Duolingo in hopes to one day visit my family in Peru.
